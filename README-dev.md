Native Windows x64 VST3 drum sample player foundation.

## Permanent identity

- Product: `SV-Drummer`
- Manufacturer: `sl23`
- Manufacturer code: `sl23`
- Plug-in code: `svd1`
- Bundle ID: `com.sl23.svdrummer`
- Version: `1.0.0`

## Stage 1 features

- Sixteen coloured sample pads in two rows of eight.
- Drag supported audio files from the internal browser or Windows Explorer.
- Multiple sample-library folders, displayed as a lazy-loading folder tree.
- WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC and AIFF sample loading through JUCE audio formats.
- Waveform and sample name on every pad.
- MIDI notes 36–51 by default; click or mouse-wheel the note field to change it.
- Mouse and MIDI pad triggering with MIDI velocity.
- Per-pad mute, solo, volume, pan, tune and reverse controls.
- Portable settings under `dist\Data\Settings`.
- Reserved portable folders for samples and future patterns.
- Samples/Patterns browser tabs and Sequencer/Pad Settings view foundation.

The sequencer, pattern slots, pattern MIDI switching, advanced waveform editor,
amp/filter/LFO controls, looping and choke groups are intentionally reserved for
later stages.

Stage 1.1 corrects the Windows `max` macro collision reported by the first
Visual Studio 2026 build.

Stage 1.2 enables JUCE's self-contained MP3 decoder and explicitly enables
WAV, OGG and FLAC support. SF2 SoundFont loading is reserved for a later
sampler-engine stage because it requires preset, key-zone and velocity-zone
handling rather than ordinary audio-file decoding.

## Build

In the Project Root, double-click `- Build.bat`.

The script closes `PolyHostInterface.exe`, builds the Release VST3 and creates:

`dist\SV-Drummer.vst3`

Build output is also saved to `Results.log`.
